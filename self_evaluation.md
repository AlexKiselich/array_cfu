# My Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel pretty confident so far. But there are many Array methods I still need to learn.

- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I think I can move on. I have booked marked the Ruby Doc for all the different array methods so having that will be nice to look back at.

- What questions do you have about Arrays?
No really big questions, I am just excited to keep learning!
